    """Computes the positive peaks of the input vector x
       Python adaption from the Matlab Roeder_Peak_Picking script peaks.m from the Chroma Toolbox
       reckjn 2017

    Parameters
    ----------

    x                 signal to be searched for (positive) peaks

    dir               +1 for forward peak searching, -1 for backward peak
                      searching. default is dir == -1.

    abs_thresh        absolute threshold signal, i.e. only peaks
                      satisfying x(i)>=abs_thresh(i) will be reported.
                      abs_thresh must have the same number of samples as x.
                      a sensible choice for this parameter would be a global or local
                      average or median of the signal x.
                      if omitted, half the median of x will be used.

    rel_thresh        relative threshold signal. only peak positions i with an
                      uninterrupted positive ascent before position i of at least
                      rel_thresh(i) and a possibly interrupted (see parameter descent_thresh)
                      descent of at least rel_thresh(i) will be reported.
                      rel_thresh must have the same number of samples as x.
                      a sensible choice would be some measure related to the
                      global or local variance of the signal x.
                      if omitted, half the standard deviation of x will be used.

    descent_thresh    descent threshold. during peak candidate verfication, if a slope change
                      from negative to positive slope occurs at sample i BEFORE the descent has
                      exceeded rel_thresh(i), and if descent_thresh(i) has not been exceeded yet,
                      the current peak candidate will be dropped.
                      this situation corresponds to a secondary peak
                      occuring shortly after the current candidate peak (which might lead
                      to a higher peak value)!

                      the value descent_thresh(i) must not be larger than rel_thresh(i).

                      descent_thresh must have the same number of samples as x.
                      a sensible choice would be some measure related to the
                      global or local variance of the signal x.
                      if omitted, 0.5*rel_thresh will be used.

    tmin              index of start sample. peak search will begin at x(tmin).

    tmax              index of end sample. peak search will end at x(tmax).
